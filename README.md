3 cascade rules:
specificity:helps determine which rule to apply when multiple declarations exist.
            inline styles have highest specificity.
            specificity order:id selector > class selector > type selector
            when same selectors are used the rule with more no. of selectors is chosen.
inheritance:rules applied to parent element automatically transfer to child elements unless specifically targetted.
rule order:if all the above given rules are unable to decide which rule is superior than the last defined rule is the one that is ultimately applied.
