## **CSS Foundations**

learnt to apply the following properties color(text color), background color,text align, font size, font family, font weight etc.
learnt how to add color using various formats like rgb,hsl,hex and keyword.

### **Cascade**-helps determine which css rules get applied to html elements
3 cascade rules:
specificity:helps determine which rule to apply when multiple declarations exist.
            inline styles have highest specificity.
            specificity order:id selector > class selector > type selector
            when same selectors are used the rule with more no. of selectors is chosen.
inheritance:rules applied to parent element automatically transfer to child elements unless specifically targetted.
rule order:if all the above given rules are unable to decide which rule is superior than the last defined rule is the one that is ultimately applied.

### **Block and Inline**
Css has two box models-block and inline
block-new elements start from the next line.(E.g:div)
inline-new elements continue from the same line as the elements beside them.(E.g:span)
inline-block-elements with this display type behave like inline, but their padding and margin is similar to that of block.
### **Div and Span**
Div and span are elemnts that do not add an meaning to their content, or have any affect on they content enclose, and are used extensively to group elements under a single parent element, and be distinguished by giving class or id which helps in styling;
div is used primarily to group block elements while span is used to group inline elements.
